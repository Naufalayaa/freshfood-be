/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `conditionOptions` on the `Product` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `categoryId` to the `Product` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `price` on the `Product` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
